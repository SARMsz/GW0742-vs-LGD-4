<h1>GW0742 vs LGD-4: What I Learned Using Both</h1>

<p>I’ve tested a lot of SARMs and PPARδ agonists over the last few years. Some hit hard, others are just hype. GW0742 and LGD-4 are both newer options, and I ran solo cycles of each to see what they’re really about. If you're trying to decide between the two, this article will help you understand the real-world results, side effects, and what each one is best for.</p>

<h2>What Are They?</h2>

<h3>GW0742</h3>
<p>GW0742 is a PPARδ receptor agonist — similar to Cardarine (GW501516), but more potent in lab studies. It’s not a SARM, but it's used to enhance fat metabolism, boost endurance, and improve cardiovascular output. Think of it like a fat-burning stamina booster.</p>

<h3>LGD-4</h3>
<p>LGD-4 is the upgraded version of LGD-4033 (Ligandrol). It’s a powerful SARM made for building lean muscle and strength, with reduced androgenic side effects. Basically, a cleaner muscle builder that still hits hard.</p>

<h2>My Testing Protocol</h2>

<p>I ran each compound for a 6-week solo cycle. Diet and training stayed consistent. No other SARMs or PEDs were used. I tracked:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Endurance & cardio output</li>
  <li>Fat loss</li>
  <li>Strength and muscle growth</li>
  <li>Side effects</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s break down each one based on my experience.</p>

<h2>GW0742 Review</h2>

<p>I used 10mg/day for 6 weeks. I ran GW0742 fasted in the morning, and I felt the difference by week 2. My cardio was smoother. I could push longer on sprints, bike rides, and even my lifting volume increased. It made fasted cardio way more bearable too.</p>

<p>I didn’t expect much body comp change, but I dropped about 2.5% body fat by the end of the cycle — with no loss in strength or muscle. I didn’t feel stimmed out like with clen or ECA stacks. It’s more of a steady fuel effect.</p>

<p>No side effects that I noticed. Sleep stayed good. No crashes. No liver issues. It's clean.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, cardio/endurance, body recomposition</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day (oral solution)</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Boosts cardio and VO2 max</li>
  <li>Burns fat without losing muscle</li>
  <li>No suppression</li>
  <li>Stacks well with SARMs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No muscle-building effect on its own</li>
  <li>Can take 2–3 weeks to kick in</li>
</ul>

<h2>LGD-4 Review</h2>

<p>I ran LGD-4 at 10mg/day, same setup — solo for 6 weeks. LGD-4 hit fast. Week 2 my strength was already climbing, and by week 4 my muscles looked fuller, harder, and more defined. Gained 6 lbs lean mass total, without any bloating or water weight.</p>

<p>Workouts felt intense. Recovery time dropped. I could train more often, especially big compound lifts. By far one of the most anabolic SARMs I’ve tried, just under RAD140 but with fewer side effects.</p>

<p>I felt mild suppression around week 5. Libido dipped a bit, and I felt a bit tired in the mornings. Did a 3-week mini PCT and bounced back quick.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Bulking, strength, recomp</p>

<p><strong>Dose used:</strong> 10mg/day (oral solution)</p>

<p><strong>Where I got it:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/lgd4/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LGD-4 from Chemyo</a></p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fast lean muscle growth</li>
  <li>Strength gains in 2 weeks</li>
  <li>Improves recovery</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Suppression kicks in by week 5</li>
  <li>Needs PCT</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which One Is Better?</h2>

<p>Depends on your goal.</p>

<p><strong>For endurance, cutting, and body fat:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/gw0742/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GW0742</a> is a beast. It’s like cardio in a bottle — without any stimulants or side effects.</p>

<p><strong>For strength, muscle growth, and performance:</strong> <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/lgd4/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">LGD-4</a> is the winner. It builds real size and power fast.</p>

<p>If you're serious about results, these two actually <em>stack great</em> together. GW0742 boosts endurance and fat loss, while LGD-4 builds muscle. I may test that stack next cycle.</p>

<h2>FAQs: GW0742 vs LGD-4</h2>

<h3>Can I use these together?</h3>
<p>Yes. They stack well. GW0742 doesn't cause suppression, so it balances out LGD-4 nicely.</p>

<h3>Which one helps more with fat loss?</h3>
<p>GW0742. It burns fat directly and boosts cardio.</p>

<h3>Which is stronger for muscle gain?</h3>
<p>LGD-4. It builds lean mass and increases strength fast.</p>

<h3>Do I need PCT after using these?</h3>
<p>LGD-4: Yes, mild suppression kicks in after 4–5 weeks.<br>
GW0742: No PCT needed.</p>

<h3>Is GW0742 better than Cardarine?</h3>
<p>In my experience, yes. GW0742 felt cleaner and more potent, especially for endurance.</p>

<h3>Where can I buy real GW0742 and LGD-4?</h3>
<p>I used Chemyo for both. Lab-tested and reliable:<br>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Both of these are legit research compounds with serious benefits. If I had to pick one for my next goal:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>GW0742</strong> for shredding and conditioning</li>
  <li><strong>LGD-4</strong> for size, power, and gym dominance</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose based on what you want out of your cycle. And always use third-party tested sources — that’s why I go with Chemyo.</p>

<p><strong>Train smart. Train hard.</strong></p>
